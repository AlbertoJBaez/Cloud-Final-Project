# Cloud & Devops team repository

## Welcome to the team's repository

This repo contains the contribution of Cloud team (Alberto Jim√©nez) in the [End-of-Course project](https://github.com/desafioteam1) of Group 1 in [The Bridge Bootcamp](https://www.thebridge.tech/?utm_medium=ppc&utm_source=adwords&utm_campaign=GA_The+Bridge_Marca&utm_term=the%20bridge%20digital%20talent%20accelerator&hsa_kw=the%20bridge%20digital%20talent%20accelerator&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&hsa_cam=6496961935&hsa_ad=549241137266&hsa_acc=1272778203&hsa_src=g&hsa_grp=82036397030&hsa_mt=e&hsa_tgt=kwd-871631829007&gclid=CjwKCAjw38SoBhB6EiwA8EQVLunbzVugN_VHOL1Njxdi6G6iMTx0ddCNkAFqmIgM6EGE1OdYzObFlxoCzIcQAvD_BwE) (April-August 2023).

The an end-of-course project has been developed by professionals from: UX UI product design, cybersecurity, data science, full stack web development, digital marketing and cloud/devOps; in order to solve a problem raised in a brief and value the experience of each area. Therefore, the cloud team was tasked with integrating the work of the other teams into an efficient, effective and secure cloud architecture.


This repo will show the role of the Cloud team in the project.

## Objectives of the team

Compliance with the following objectives was mandatory for the successful completion of the project

- **Select the Cloud account** associated with the project group. Choose the cloud service that best suits the project requirements.
- **Assign permissions to the team**. Establish the team members who will have access to the project. Create access levels and resource allocation.
- **Cloud infrastructure deployment**: Design a cloud infrastructure using AWS, Azure or GCP services. The architecture to be set up must be properly painted in the corresponding tools.
- **Infrastructure automation and management**: The provisioning and management of cloud infrastructure should be automated. This involves defining and deploying infrastructure as code (IaC) and using automation techniques to configure and update it.
- **Implementation of CI/CD pipelines**: Students must establish a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) flow. They must build an application that allows the automated construction and deployment of the developed application or services.
- **Define the CI architecture** according to the type and language of the application to be developed.
- **Define the CD architecture** according to the objective (Dev only, Dev and Prod).
- **Monitoring and log managemen**t: Implement a monitoring solution, where developers can check the status of their deployed solution at all times.
- **Security and compliance**: Learners must secure the infrastructure and application through good security practices so that it cannot be misused by elements outside the organisation or misused by elements within the organisation.
